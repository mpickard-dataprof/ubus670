# Workspace Reminders

- **Folder Structure:** Strictly adhere to the `Materials/Week X/Day Y` hierarchy. Never create new top-level folders.
- **File Management:** Keep all final, intermediate, and source files (like `.md` files) inside the specific Day folder.
- **Slide Deck Skill:** Clean up the `create-google-slides` skill. The user prefers the **HTML approach** (Metadata in HTML comments within Markdown).
- **Instructional Style:** Adhere to the "Visual Educator Rule" (Rich content, analogies, high-quality visuals, no text-heavy slides).
- **Progression:** NEVER ask to proceed to the next day. Wait for explicit user confirmation.
- **Iteration:** Aim for 2-3 iterations per day to perfect the materials.
