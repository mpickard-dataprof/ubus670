 
- the lab will need to change after the slides are changed.  Less focus on "ai document readiness".
- Have the students create a Google Gem (they can upload the documents as part of its "Knowledge").  Maybe have the students compare bewteen uploading documents to a normal Gemini chat and uploading the context documents to the "Knowledge" of a GEmini Gem.  You can remove the ChatGPT backup plan.
- I don't liek the Data Privacy Assessment -->  Let's focus on experimenting with context engineering.
- I like the Stress-Testing Your Assistant section.  Keep it!
- I like the Adding Context Mid-Conversation section.  Keep it!
- Add a section where the students test the agent's ability to cite sources.  The idea is that when they ask a specific question the answer should have come from a specific document (or multiple documents).
- I like Context Comparison Experiment.  Keep it.  But, per my GEmini Gem feedback, incorporate a Gemini Gem setup.  SO, I'm thinking we given them experience with different "context engineering" approaches:  none, gemini gem, upload documents to normal chat.
- Definitely keep the "Compare with Classmates".  NOTE: you can share Gems (send links) --> incorporate this.
