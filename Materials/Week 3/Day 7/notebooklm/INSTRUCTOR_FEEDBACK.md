# Instructor Feedback — Day 7: Introduction to Agentic AI

## Overall
This is the first day of Week 3 and marks a significant conceptual shift — from single AI (Days 5-6) to multi-agent AI. The text content is solid and well-structured. The main gap is visual: the scaffolding is entirely text-based and needs diagrams, illustrations, and visual metaphors to make the abstract concepts tangible for non-technical MBA students. The Beacon continuity is strong — we're building directly on Days 5-6 work.

## Specific Slide Feedback

### Slide 1 — Title Slide
Good title. Needs a strong visual that communicates "teamwork" or "collaboration" in an AI context. Perhaps multiple interconnected nodes, or a team of specialized robots/agents. Keep it professional, not cartoonish.

### Slide 2 — Learning Objectives
Standard objectives slide. The 4 Bloom's verbs (Define, Explain, Identify, Build) should be visually distinct — perhaps color-coded or with icons. Make "Build" stand out since it's the hands-on outcome.

### Slide 3 — Day 6 → Day 7 Bridge
This is a critical transition slide. Needs visual continuity from Day 6 (red teaming / defense) to Day 7 (multi-agent / collaboration). The comparison table should be visual, not just text. Perhaps a before/after or evolution visual: single hardened AI → two collaborating AIs.

### Slide 4 — Limitations of Single LLM Calls
The 4 limitations need iconography or visual representation. "No self-correction, no verification, no memory, no tools" — each could have a simple icon. The Beacon box about Day 5's email system having no second opinion should be visually prominent.

### Slide 5 — The Vision: AI Teams
The comparison table (Single AI vs. AI Team) needs to be more than just a table. Consider a visual metaphor: solo worker vs. organized department. This is the "aha moment" slide — make it visually compelling.

### Slide 6 — Agent vs. LLM Call
The stranger-vs-employee analogy is good but needs a strong visual. Two contrasting figures: a random person on the street vs. a badged, equipped team member with tools. The comparison table has 5 rows — make sure each is visually distinct and not just a wall of text.

### Slide 7 — Agent Anatomy (Perception → Reasoning → Action)
This is the most important conceptual diagram in the deck. Needs a clear, memorable 3-part visual: Perception (eye/input), Reasoning (brain/gear), Action (hand/output). Map each to the Beacon example. This diagram will be referenced throughout the rest of the course.

### Slide 8 — Agent Instructions
The Day 5 → Day 7 evolution table is important. Show visually how system prompts grow into agent instructions — perhaps a building-blocks metaphor where new layers are added on top of the Day 5 foundation.

### Slide 9 — Real-World Business Agents
The 4-example table works well but needs visual differentiation. Each business agent example (email triage, expense processing, compliance, resume screening) should have a distinct icon or visual. These examples prove that the perception-reasoning-action pattern is universal.

### Slide 10 — Agent Governance
Trust boundaries, human-in-the-loop, monitoring, audit trail — these need icons or a governance framework diagram. Connect back to Day 6's governance discussion. The Quality Checker as automatic audit trail is a key insight — highlight it visually.

### Checkpoint Quiz 1 — Agent Concepts
Light theme (white/light gray background, dark text). 4 options in a 2x2 grid. Keep it clean and interactive-looking.

### Slide 11 — Section Divider: Orchestration Patterns
Needs a strong visual section break. Perhaps a blueprint or architecture drawing metaphor. "How Agents Work Together" should feel like entering a new chapter.

### Slide 12 — Sequential Pattern
The assembly line metaphor needs a clear visual: boxes connected by arrows flowing left to right. Agent A → Agent B → Agent C. Map to Beacon: Email → Triage Agent → Quality Checker → Output. Make the flow direction unmistakable.

### Slide 13 — Parallel Pattern
Visual contrast with sequential: instead of a single line, show multiple parallel lanes. Like multiple checkout lanes in a store, or multiple assembly lines running simultaneously. The convergence point (results merged) should be clear.

### Slide 14 — Loop Pattern
Circular flow with a quality gate. Draft → Review → Decision point (good enough? / try again?). The iterative nature should be visually obvious — a loop or spiral, not a straight line. Include the "max attempts" safety valve concept.

### Slide 15 — Decision Matrix
The 3-pattern comparison table is crucial for practical application. Needs to be a clean, scannable reference card that students can refer back to. Consider color-coding each pattern consistently (same colors used in slides 12-14).

### Checkpoint Quiz 2 — Pattern Selection
Light theme. Practical scenario-based question about batch email processing. Keep it clean and aligned with Quiz 1's visual style.

### Slide 16 — Lab Preview
The 5-part lab overview table should be clean and inviting. Each part could have a small icon. Emphasize that they're building something real — a working two-agent system.

### Slide 17 — Key Takeaways
4 takeaways should be visually memorable. Perhaps 4 cards or icons. "Start with verification" is the most actionable takeaway — make it stand out as the practical recommendation.

### Slide 18 — Days 8-9 Preview
The 3-agent resume screening preview should show the scale-up from today's 2-agent system. Visual: 2 agents (today) → 3+ agents (capstone). Create excitement about what's coming.

### Slide 19 — Questions
Simple, clean. Perhaps a visual callback to the key themes of the day.

## Visual Design Notes (from UX Review)
- All text must be readable at projection distance — minimum 14px equivalent for body text
- Section dividers need visual elements (icons, illustrations) to break monotony
- Maintain consistent color coding: Red (#C8102E) for emphasis/action, Navy (#1D428A) for structure/headers, Blue (#00A9E0) for information
- The three orchestration patterns MUST be visually distinct — different layouts, not just different labels on the same layout
- Agent anatomy diagram should be reusable — it will be referenced in future days
- Maintain Beacon branding continuity from Days 5-6
