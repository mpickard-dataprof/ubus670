# NotebookLM Project Brief — Day 7: Introduction to Agentic AI

## Course Context
- **Course:** UBUS 670 — AI for Business Leaders (MBA, Spring 2026)
- **Institution:** Northern Illinois University (NIU)
- **Day:** 7 of 9 (Week 3, Day 7 — Monday)
- **Topic:** Introduction to Agentic AI — From Single AI to AI Teams
- **Audience:** MBA students with no technical background; business-focused framing required
- **Prerequisite knowledge:** Days 5-6 covered AI system prompts, parameter tuning, red teaming, and system prompt hardening. Students have built and tested Beacon's email triage system using Google AI Studio.

## This Slide Deck
This is the opening lecture of Week 3 (multi-agent AI + capstone). It transitions students from single-AI systems (Days 5-6) to multi-agent architectures. The core scenario: extending Beacon's email triage with a second AI agent that verifies the first agent's classifications — delivering on Day 6's closing promise: "What if one AI could check another?"

The deck covers: (1) why single AI has limits, (2) what makes an agent different from an LLM call, (3) agent anatomy (perception-reasoning-action), (4) three orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, loop), and (5) a preview of the hands-on lab where students build a two-agent sequential pipeline.

**Current state:** Text-based Reveal.js scaffolding with full content, speaker notes, and 2 checkpoint quizzes. Needs visual redesign — professional illustrations, diagrams, and consistent visual language.

## Brand Identity
- **Primary colors:** NIU Red (#C8102E), Black (#000000)
- **Secondary colors:** Navy (#1D428A), Blue (#00A9E0), Green (#43B02A)
- **Background:** White (#FFFFFF) — clean, professional
- **Heading font:** Montserrat (bold, clean)
- **Body font:** Georgia (readable serif)
- **Style:** Professional, clean, minimal — not playful or cartoonish

## Known Issues (See INSTRUCTOR_FEEDBACK.md for details)
- The scaffolding is text-only — needs visual diagrams for agent anatomy, orchestration patterns, and the sequential pipeline
- The stranger-vs-employee analogy for Agent vs. LLM Call needs a strong visual metaphor
- The three orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, loop) need clear, distinct visual representations
- The Day 6 → Day 7 bridge slide needs visual continuity with the red teaming theme

## What We Want From NotebookLM
1. **Visual design** — consistent illustrations, professional layouts, strong whitespace
2. **Content preservation** — all content has been accuracy-checked and updated; preserve the facts and figures exactly
3. **Better visual metaphors** — especially for: agent anatomy (perception-reasoning-action cycle), three orchestration patterns (sequential/parallel/loop), agent vs. LLM call distinction, the verification pattern (one AI checking another)
4. **Educational flow** — clearer scaffolding with visual section breaks between major sections
5. **Business framing** — every technical concept tied to Beacon Retail Group's email triage scenario
6. **Readable at distance** — large fonts, clear hierarchy, designed for projection in a lecture hall

## Critical Output Requirement
The slides will be used **as full-bleed background images** in Reveal.js. They must be:
- Visually self-contained (all text and graphics baked into each slide image)
- High quality at 16:9 aspect ratio
- Readable at presentation scale (large fonts, clear hierarchy)
- Consistent visual style across all slides

## What to Preserve
- All 4 learning objectives (Define, Explain, Identify, Build)
- The stranger-vs-employee analogy for Agent vs. LLM Call
- The perception-reasoning-action framework with Beacon mappings
- All 3 orchestration patterns with business examples
- The decision matrix for pattern selection
- Day 6 → Day 7 bridge content
- Days 8-9 capstone preview (resume screening with 3+ agents)
- Both checkpoint quiz questions and answer options
- All speaker notes content (these guide the instructor)
