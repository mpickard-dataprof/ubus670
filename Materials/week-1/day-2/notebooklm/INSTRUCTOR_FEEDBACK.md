# Instructor Feedback on Day 2 Slides

## Summary

Six issues were identified from the instructor's review of the current Day 2 (Prompt Engineering) slide deck. These range from labeling clarity to layout overflows and missing content. Each issue is described below with the slide number, the problem, and what the fix should accomplish.

## Issue 1: Slide 17 — Ambiguous Chain-of-Thought Example Labeling

**Problem:** The Chain-of-Thought prompting example on slide 17 does not clearly distinguish between what the user types (the input prompt) and what the AI generates (the output). Students unfamiliar with AI interactions cannot tell which text is theirs and which is the AI's response.

**Fix:** Add explicit, visually distinct labels such as "Prompt:" and "AI Output:" to separate the input from the response. Use different background colors, font styles, or boxed regions so the distinction is immediately obvious at a glance.

## Issue 2: Slide 19 — Flowchart Alignment

**Problem:** The "When to Use What" decision flowchart has misaligned arrows and blocks. The visual flow is hard to follow, which undermines the purpose of a decision-aid diagram.

**Fix:** Redesign the flowchart with properly aligned nodes, clear directional arrows, and consistent spacing. The flow should read naturally (top-to-bottom or left-to-right) so students can quickly determine which prompting technique to use for a given task.

## Issue 3: Slide 20 — Layout Overflow on Checkpoint Quiz

**Problem:** The checkpoint quiz content on slide 20 extends beyond the visible slide area — the bottom portion is cut off and unreadable during presentation.

**Fix:** Either condense the quiz content to fit within a single slide (shorter answer explanations, tighter spacing) or split it across two slides. All content must be fully visible at presentation resolution without scrolling.

## Issue 4: Slide 22 — Weak Iteration Cycle Diagram

**Problem:** The Generate/Evaluate/Specify/Regenerate iteration cycle diagram on slide 22 is visually underwhelming. It does not convey the dynamic, cyclical nature of prompt iteration.

**Fix:** Redesign the diagram with stronger visual impact — use a circular or spiral layout, bolder colors, icons for each stage, and clear directional arrows that convey the iterative loop. The diagram should be a memorable visual that students associate with the iteration process.

## Issue 5: Slide 22 — Missing AI-Assisted Prompting Tip

**Problem:** The iteration section does not mention that students can use AI tools themselves to improve their prompts. This is a practical, high-value tip that is currently absent.

**Fix:** Add a prominent callout or tip box with guidance such as: "Use AI to improve your prompts! Paste your prompt into Gemini or ChatGPT and ask: 'How can I make this prompt more effective?' AI is surprisingly good at helping you write better prompts." This should be visually highlighted (e.g., a colored tip box) so students notice and remember it.

## Issue 6: Slide 23 — Prompt Library Needs Practical How-To

**Problem:** The "Keep a prompt library" iteration strategy tells students WHAT to do but not HOW. Students need concrete, actionable steps for building and maintaining a prompt library.

**Fix:** Add practical guidance covering:
- **Where to keep it:** Google Doc, Notion page, shared spreadsheet, or dedicated tool
- **How to organize:** Group by function (HR, Marketing, Finance, Customer Service), add tags
- **What to include per entry:** Prompt name, category, technique used, the prompt text with placeholder variables, usage tips, and version history
- **How to maintain it:** Update when someone finds a better version, track what changed and why

Include a concrete example entry so students can see exactly what a prompt library looks like in practice.
