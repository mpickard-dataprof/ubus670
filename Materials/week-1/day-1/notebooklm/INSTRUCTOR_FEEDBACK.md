# Instructor Feedback on Day 1 Slides

## General Slide Feedback

- The text and bulleting layout still needs improvement
- Use an image generation agent to generate better images (instead of logo-like images)
- Improve the "whitespace balance" — some slides have too much whitespace, other slides have text and bullets that need more whitespace
- Expand the "Part 2: How do LLMs Actually Work" section. Use the slides and content from the reference PPTX as an example of the depth of knowledge and presentation of knowledge about LLMs. Cover embeddings as well.
  - Keep the content in Part 2. Just expand it. Slides 9-14 are good.
- Slide 15 — the checkpoint quiz is not working. The answers are already selected. Make it interactive.
- Part 3: Hallucination Problem — add more examples, flesh it out
- Part 5: Meet Google Gemini — want more details for non-tech-savvy students to help them come up to speed on Gemini. Go beyond the obvious (many have probably used ChatGPT).
- Improve slide 22 "Why We're Using Gemini" — mainly the text layout

## Specific Visual Annotations (from annotated screenshots)

### Slide 3 (Beacon Retail Group)
- "Use an image generating agent. Generate better, high-resolution images that still are relevant to the text and topics."
- The current Beacon logo is a generic store clip art icon — needs a proper, professional illustration

### Slide 2 (Learning Objectives)
- "Need more whitespace around bullets. Font size needs to be increased."
- "Can bullet alignment be shifted to the right so the numbers align with the left of 'By the end....'?"

### Section Dividers (e.g., Part 1 slide)
- "Fill more of the screen" — too much dead space on the full-color section divider slides

## Lab Feedback (for context)

- Students do not have Google Workspace at NIU (remove references)
- Remove "accept any terms of service" step
- Remove tip about multiple Gemini models. Replace with "No need to upgrade if prompted, the free version is sufficient"
- Add a box about selecting the model (lower right corner of the input box)
- Please visit gemini.google.com and explore the interface to make the lab section up-to-date
- The hallucination hunt exercise may not work — modern models are good at recognizing when they don't have info about fictional companies. Need brainstorming on alternatives.
- Need a way to collect student responses for grading
- Add more quiz questions — shoot for 20 questions per day with variants
