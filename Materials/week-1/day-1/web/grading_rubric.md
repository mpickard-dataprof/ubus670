## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Tasks** | All three tasks (Summarization, Q&A, Drafting) are completed with thoughtful, specific reflections on the output quality. | Tasks are completed, but reflections are brief or generic. | One or more tasks are missing or reflections show lack of engagement. |
| **Hallucination Hunt** | Provides a clear, verifiable example of a hallucination with a specific explanation of why it is incorrect. | Identifies a hallucination but the explanation of the error is vague. | Fails to document a hallucination or misidentifies a correct fact as a hallucination. |
| **Strategic Reflection** | Reflections connect AI capabilities directly to Beacon Retail's specific business context (HR, Marketing, or Finance). | Reflections are accurate but stay at a general "AI is useful" level without specific Beacon context. | Reflections are superficial, extremely short, or logically inconsistent. |
| **Professionalism** | Submissions are well-structured, clear, and use professional business tone in all written areas. | Generally professional with minor clarity or formatting issues. | Unprofessional tone, disorganized thoughts, or difficult to read. |

## 🤖 AI Feedback Protocol

    3.  Final score should reflect both technical completion and the quality of their strategic thinking.
