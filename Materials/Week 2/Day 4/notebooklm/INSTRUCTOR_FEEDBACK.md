# Instructor Feedback — Day 4: Multimodal AI

## Overall
- The whole topic content and flow needs reworking
- Too much focus on "document readiness" and "good documents" — same issue as Day 3
- Need deep research on real-world business applications of multimodal AI
- Add more material about real-world business examples tied to types of multimodal tasks (visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image, image-to-image, etc.)
- Build on context engineering from Day 3, but now the context is multimodal
- The "receipt processor" scenario may need to be reconsidered or expanded
- Update the Quick Recap to reflect Day 3 revisions

## Specific Slide Feedback

### Slide 5 — Image
- Image needs improvement — should be reviewed by expert reviewers or generated with Veo/image generation agent

### Slide 9 — Discussion (Multimodal Data in Business)
- Good discussion idea but needs to go deeper
- Focus on multimodal data generated in real business scenarios and how GenAI helps use it
- Real-world examples to incorporate:
  - Warehouse drones for inventory management (visual inspection)
  - Influencer/marketing analysis of YouTube video content
  - Scanned invoice processing
  - Vocal analysis of customer support call recordings
  - Be creative — think of more

### Slide 13 — Text Extraction Flowchart
- Text extraction step is outdated — may still apply to structured forms only
- Flowchart/image needs enhancing — should have been reviewed by expert reviewer

### Slide 14 — Document Readiness
- Too much focus on document readiness (same issue as Day 3)
- Rework entirely — do deep research on business possibilities of multimodal AI
- Integrate findings in an interactive, engaging way
- Remember: we're building on context engineering, but now context is multimodal
- Reconsider the "Receipts Scenario" — can Veo generate images of invoices, inventory boxes?

### Slide 16 — Structured Outputs
- Good concept: turning unstructured images/audio/video into structured, informative outputs
- Keep and strengthen this angle

### Slide 17 — ROI
- Incorporate ROI aspects of real-world multimodal AI applications

### Slide 24 — Human in the Loop
- Yes, include human-in-the-loop concepts
- Improve the image/flowchart

### Slide 26 — Handwriting Recognition
- Good idea — can we generate images of handwritten text?
- Recognizing initials on invoices, handwritten notes, etc.

### Slide 31 — Needs Serious Rework
- See instructor screenshot feedback (slide31 in feedback folder)

### Slide 33 — Summary
- Update when real-world business applications are reworked

## Lab Feedback
- Lab needs full rework based on slide revisions
- The "receipt processor" idea may need reconsideration
- Handwritten receipts should be actual images, not text — investigate image generation
- MAIN DIRECTIVE: Brainstorm what's possible for a true multimodal lab — deep research on creating multimodal assets (images, audio, video) as LLM context
