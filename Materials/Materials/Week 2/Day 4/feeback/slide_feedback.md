### General Feedback
- update the Quick Recap based on revisions to Day 3.
- I think we are going to rework the whole topic content and flow.
- add more material about real-world business examples (see Slide 9 feedback for ideas) and tie them to types of multimodal tasks (e.g., visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, etc.)

### Slide 5
- image needs improvement  (make sure you send the material to the expert reviewers -- this would be a good candiate to create using Veo or the image generation agent)
-

### Slide 9
- I like this discussion idea, but let's take it deeper.  The focus is on multimodal data that is generated in business scenarios and how we use it and how gen ai can help us use it.  Here are some examples that come to mind:  [warehouse drones for inventory management](https://youtu.be/_YfbTpxE8_Q?si=W5mWrTCIh6SI7VE2), influencers and marketing on youtube video, scanned invoice processing, vocalic analysis of customer support center call recordings...be creative think of others, BUT definitely use real-world business examples

### Slide 13
- the text extraction step is definitley "out-of-date".  This might apply to extracting data from structure forms
- And the flowchart / image needs enhancing.  This should have been reviewed by an expert reviewer.


### Slide 14
- like Day 3 --> too much focus on document readiness and "good documents".  Rework all this and probably don't even touch on it in this lesson.  Go do deep research on business-related possiblities of multimodal AI and then integrate them in this lesson in an interactive, engaging way.  Remember to build on context engineering (but now the context is multimodal).  So we may need to reconsider the "Receipts Scenario".  Can you use Veo to generate images of invoices?  Or imagage of inventory boxes (see the drone video I referenced above)

### Slide 16
- I like the idea of revisiting structure outputs.  Specifically, the idea of turning an unstructure image, audio, or video into a structured, informative output.

### Slide 17
- definitely incorporate the ROI aspects of real-world applications of multimodal AI

### Slide 24
- Yes!  Let's include human in the loop.
- Improve the image / flowchart.

### Slide 26
- I like the handwriting idea.  Can you generate images of handwritten text? Or as you already reference, handwriting on invoices -- like recognizing whose initials are on an invioce -- or other notes.

### Slide 31
- needs serious rework. See my screenshot.

### Slide 33
- update this when you rework the multimodal examples and real-world business applications.
