# The "Digital Workforce" Mindset
We are no longer using tools; we are **managing resources**.

An "Agentic System" is not a chatbot. It is a software entity that can:
1.  **Plan:** Break down complex goals.
2.  **Use Tools:** Search the web, query databases, send emails.
3.  **Persist:** It doesn't stop until the job is done.

# Augmentation vs. Automation
**The Manager's Decision**

**Augmentation** (Human-in-the-loop)
*   AI drafts the email; Human reviews and sends.
*   **Goal:** Efficiency.

**Automation** (Human-on-the-loop)
*   AI identifies fraud and triggers an alert.
*   **Goal:** Scalability.

# The Core Analogy: Intern vs. Consultant
**The Unprepared Intern**
*   *Prompt:* "Write a Q3 report."

*   *Result:* Generic template.
***
**The Briefed Consultant**
*   *Prompt:* "Using these sales CSVs, write a report on our 15% growth."
*   *Input:* Data + Constraints + Goal.
*   *Result:* Finished asset.

# Multimodal Reasoning: The "Eyes" of Business
Text is only 20% of corporate data. The rest is visual and auditory.

**Multimodality** allows AI to:
*   **Operations:** Spot defects in a video stream.
*   **Marketing:** Reverse-engineer competitor branding.
*   **Finance:** Ingest 10 years of physical ledger scans.

# Governance: The Manager's Audit
**Risk Management**
*   **Explainability:** Can the AI show its work?
*   **Grounding:** Is it anchored in facts or training patterns?
***
**The Audit Checklist**
1.  Verify the source data.
2.  Test for bias in high-stakes decisions.
3.  Identify "Agentic Drift" (the AI deviating from the goal).
