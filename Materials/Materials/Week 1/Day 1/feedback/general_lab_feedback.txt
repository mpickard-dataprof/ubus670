## LAB FEEDBACK

### Part 1: Setting up Gemini
#### 1. Setting Up Gemini
- Students do not have Google Workspace at NIU (remove references to it)
- remove the "accept any terms of service" step
- remove the tip about multiple gemini models available. Perhaps replace it with something like "No need to upgrade if it prompts, the free version is sufficient for this class"

#### 2. Explore the Interface
- Add a box about selecting the model (lower right-corning of the "Input box").
- there is not "Response actions"
- Please go to gemini.google.com and explore the interface to improve this section in general and make it up-to-date and aligned with the latest version of the interface.


### Part 2: Three Beacon Business Tasks

#### 3. Task A: Summarization
- this section is great.  A nice easy hands-on intro to using Gemini for a real-world Tasks

#### 4. Task B: Question & Answer
 - this sectino is great too.  Reinforces what was taught about context / session.

 #### 5. Task C: Drafting
- again great.

### Part 3: The Hallucination Hunt
####  6. Trigger a Hallucination
- I'm not sure this is going to work.  Models like gemini-pro today are really good at recognizing when they don't have the requested information (especially about a fictional company).  Yet, I want my students to experience a model hallucinating.  Are there other ideas? Brainstorm and iterate.  We may just stick with this, if we can't find something better.

### Part 4: Lab Reflection
- this refelection section is fine.

#### GENERAL QUESTION
- how can I collect student responses? so I can grade them or at least verify they did the work?
- same with the quiz (but I don't plan to grade them), can we add more quesitons to each quiz so if they retake they get a different set of questions.  It's okay to have some variants of existing questions.  Let's shoot for 20 questions per day (make a note of this for future days)
