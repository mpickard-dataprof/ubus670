# Project Status: UBUS 670 Materials

**Last Updated:** Thursday, February 6, 2026
**Current Focus:** Week 1 / Day 2 (starting next session)

## 🚀 Current State
- **Architecture:** HTML-based Course Hub with Reveal.js slides
- **System:** Agentic Workflow (Generator-Critic) with 4 personas in `Materials/_generator_system/`
    - UX Designer, Educational Expert, Topic Expert, Accuracy & Audience
- **Progress:**
    - ✅ `Week 1/Day 1` **COMPLETE** - What is Generative AI?
    - ⏳ `Week 1/Day 2` - Next up (topic TBD: likely Prompt Engineering)

## ✅ Day 1 Accomplishments
- Lecture slides with transformer architecture diagrams (embeddings, encoder/decoder)
- Lab with Beacon business tasks + hallucination exercise (3 fallback approaches)
- Quiz with 20-question bank, randomization, formative feedback
- Lab submission mechanism (Generate Summary → Copy/Download)
- Typography fixes (headers, list spacing, alignment)
- Lessons learned documented in `codev/lessons/0001-course-materials.md`

## ⏸ Next Action Items (Upon Resume)
1. **Begin Week 1 / Day 2:**
    - Follow `_generator_system/WORKFLOW.md`
    - Step 1: Get topic from user (Prompt Engineering? Context Engineering?)
    - Step 2: Generate prototype files
    - Step 3: Run Review Board critique
    - Step 4: Human checkpoint
    - Step 5: Finalize

2. **Apply Day 1 Lessons:**
    - Use CSS patterns from Day 1 (headers, spacing)
    - Include meaningful SVG/CSS diagrams
    - Test AI exercises before publishing
    - 20+ quiz questions with variants

## 🧠 Key Decisions & Preferences
- **Format:** Web Modules (HTML/JS) > PPTX/PDF
- **Workflow:** Always use Generator-Critic loop with human checkpoint
- **Audience:** MBA students, non-tech-savvy, no Google Workspace
- **Case Study:** Beacon Retail Group throughout all days
- **Tracking:** Use codev lifecycle (projectlist.md, lessons file)
