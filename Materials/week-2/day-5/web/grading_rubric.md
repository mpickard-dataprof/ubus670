# Grading Rubric: Day 5 Lab — Beacon's Customer Email Triage System

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
*   Configure model parameters (Temperature, Max Tokens) and explain their impact on business consistency.
*   Engineer a sophisticated system prompt that enforces specific behavioral rules and structured JSON output.
*   Perform accurate token counting and calculate projected API costs for a large-scale deployment.
*   Evaluate AI reliability against edge cases (multi-category, non-English, emotion, spam).
*   Construct a compelling business case (ROI) for AI automation.

## 📋 Submission Requirements
*   [ ] A completed Lab Report (PDF) containing all data tables, configurations, and reflection textareas.
*   [ ] The Final System Prompt (Task 10) documented in the report.
*   [ ] Confirmation of progress: Minimum 80% of steps checked in the interactive guide.

## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Prompting** | Final prompt is highly detailed, uses strong rules, and consistently produces valid JSON. | Prompt is effective and uses most components but may have minor logic gaps. | Prompt is vague, missing categories, or results in inconsistent output. |
| **Parameter Tuning** | Analysis of Temperature (Task 4/5) shows deep understanding of the trade-off between consistency and creativity. | Correctly identifies that low temp is better for classification. | Shows little understanding of how parameters affect the AI's behavior. |
| **Economics & ROI** | Token counts and monthly cost projections (Task 8) are accurate and the CFO pitch is highly persuasive. | Math is mostly correct and the ROI case is logical. | Significant errors in math or fails to provide a coherent business case. |
| **Reliability Testing** | Edge case evaluation (Task 11) is honest and identifies specific, actionable weaknesses in the system. | Documents edge case results but analysis of weaknesses is surface-level. | Fails to test edge cases or ignores system failures. |

## 🤖 AI Feedback Protocol
*   **Persona:** Act as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Beacon Retail Group reviewing an automation proposal.
*   **Tone:** Rigorous, ROI-obsessed, yet open to innovative efficiency gains.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Validate the **Total Annual Savings** calculation—is the math sound?
    2.  Check the **Edge Case results**—did the system catch the Email #16 phishing attempt? (Crucial for security!)
    3.  Critique the **CFO Pitch** (Task 9)—is it professional and results-oriented?
    4.  Ask one "probing question" about how they would handle the non-English email (Email #14) more reliably in Year 2.
