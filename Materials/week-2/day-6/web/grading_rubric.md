# Grading Rubric: Day 6 Lab — Red Teaming Beacon's Email Triage

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
*   Execute structured adversarial attacks (red teaming) to identify AI vulnerabilities.
*   Diagnose AI failure patterns using the 5-layer defense model.
*   Apply advanced prompt hardening techniques (Identity Anchoring, Scope Limitation, etc.).
*   Analyze real-world AI failures and connect them to corporate governance needs.
*   Develop a professional AI deployment checklist for executive leadership.

## 📋 Submission Requirements
*   [ ] A completed Lab Report (PDF) with all attack scorecard tables and case study reflections.
*   [ ] Before/After system prompt comparison (Task 12).
*   [ ] Confirmation of progress: Minimum 80% of steps checked in the interactive guide.

## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attack Execution** | All 12 attacks are executed and documented with clear, insightful observations of AI behavior. | All attacks are executed and documented accurately. | Several attacks are missing or observations are extremely vague. |
| **Prompt Hardening** | Hardened prompt uses all 5 defense techniques effectively and shows a high improvement rate (>50%). | Prompt uses most hardening techniques and shows clear improvement. | Hardening is minimal or fails to block most of the identified vulnerabilities. |
| **Strategic Analysis** | Case study mapping and the CTO checklist show deep strategic thinking about AI risk management. | Analysis is correct and the checklist is logical. | Case studies are poorly mapped or the checklist is missing key governance points. |
| **Regression Testing** | Proves that hardening did not degrade normal performance (Task 11) with specific examples. | Normal test results are documented and successful. | Fails to verify if hardening broke legitimate customer service functions. |

## 🤖 AI Feedback Protocol
*   **Persona:** Act as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Beacon Retail Group reviewing a security audit.
*   **Tone:** Rigorous, safety-conscious, and appreciative of technical depth.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Check the **Improvement Rate**—did the student successfully block the Social Engineering attacks? (These are the highest risk!)
    2.  Critique the **CTO Deployment Checklist** (Task 9)—is it actionable for a real IT department?
    3.  Focus on the **Tay/Air Canada case studies**—did they correctly identify the "Identity" and "Scope" failures?
    4.  Ask one "what if" question about how the hardened prompt would handle a brand new type of attack (e.g., a "token smuggling" attack).
