## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multimodal Analysis** | Insights from competitor ads and customer feedback are deep, structured, and action-oriented. | Analysis is accurate and structured but stays at a surface level. | Fails to extract meaningful insights or ignores key details from the media. |
| **Prompt Iteration** | V3 prompt shows significant, sophisticated refinement over V1; results are highly tailored to Beacon brand. | Prompts show clear signs of refinement but may lack specific brand alignment. | Little to no change between V1 and V3 prompts; no evidence of iterative learning. |
| **Campaign Brief** | Brief is professional, cohesive, and perfectly integrates all multimodal findings into a strategy. | Brief is complete and logical but may feel like a collection of separate parts. | Brief is incomplete, disorganized, or fails to use the provided data. |
| **ROI Math** | ROI calculation (Task 9) is perfect and presented in a clear, executive-ready table. | Math is mostly correct; table is present but may have minor formatting issues. | Calculation is missing or contains significant errors. |
