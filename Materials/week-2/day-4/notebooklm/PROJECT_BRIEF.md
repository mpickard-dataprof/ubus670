# NotebookLM Project Brief — Day 4: Multimodal AI

## Course Context
- **Course:** UBUS 670 — AI for Business Leaders (MBA, Spring 2026)
- **Institution:** Northern Illinois University (NIU)
- **Day:** 4 of 9 (Week 2, Day 4 — Monday)
- **Topic:** Multimodal AI — When AI Sees, Hears, and Creates
- **Audience:** MBA students with no technical background; business-focused framing required
- **Prerequisite knowledge:** Day 1 (GenAI fundamentals), Day 2 (Prompt Engineering), Day 3 (Context Engineering, RAG, Gemini Gems)

## This Slide Deck
Day 4 covers how AI processes and generates multiple types of media — not just text:

1. **What is multimodal AI** — beyond text: images, audio, video as both inputs and outputs
2. **Real-world business applications** — warehouse drone inspection, invoice processing, marketing video analysis, customer call vocal analysis, and more
3. **Types of multimodal tasks** — visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image, image-to-image translation
4. **Multimodal context engineering** — building on Day 3, but now the context includes images, audio, video
5. **Structured outputs from unstructured media** — turning images/audio/video into structured, actionable data
6. **Image generation for business** — creating marketing visuals, product mockups
7. **Human-in-the-loop** — when and why humans must review AI-generated multimodal content
8. **ROI of multimodal AI** — business case for multimodal capabilities

**Current state:** 33 slides, 1,760 lines of HTML. This day needs the most rework — instructor wants a fundamental content and flow redesign focused on real-world business applications rather than document readiness. Several placeholder images were never generated.

## Brand Identity
- **Primary colors:** NIU Red (#C8102E), Black (#000000)
- **Secondary colors:** Navy (#1D428A), Blue (#00A9E0), Green (#43B02A)
- **Background:** White (#FFFFFF) — clean, professional
- **Heading font:** Montserrat (bold, clean)
- **Body font:** Georgia (readable serif)
- **Style:** Professional, clean, minimal — not playful or cartoonish

## Known Issues (See INSTRUCTOR_FEEDBACK.md for details)
1. Whole topic needs content and flow rework — too focused on document readiness
2. Need more real-world business examples of multimodal AI
3. Receipt processor scenario may need expansion or replacement
4. Multiple images/flowcharts need improvement or replacement
5. Text extraction content is outdated
6. Missing ROI discussion for multimodal AI applications

## What We Want From NotebookLM
1. **Visual design** — consistent illustrations, professional layouts, whitespace
2. **Content restructuring** — shift focus from document readiness to real-world multimodal business applications
3. **Strong visual metaphors** — multimodal AI needs strong visuals by nature (show, don't just tell)
4. **Business examples** — warehouse drones, invoice processing, marketing analysis, call center analytics
5. **Educational flow** — build on Days 1-3 (especially context engineering) with multimodal extension

## Critical Output Requirement
The slides will be used **as full-bleed background images** in Reveal.js. They must be:
- Visually self-contained (all text and graphics baked into each slide image)
- High quality at 16:9 aspect ratio
- Readable at presentation scale (large fonts, clear hierarchy)
- Consistent visual style across all slides

## What to Preserve
- **Beacon Retail Group** case study continuity
- The concept of **structured outputs from unstructured media** (Slide 16 angle)
- **Human-in-the-loop** concepts (Slide 24)
- **Handwriting recognition** discussion (interesting edge case)
- Connection to Day 3 context engineering (now multimodal context)
- Connection to Day 5 (Google AI Studio — where students will use these capabilities)
- Learning objectives and key takeaways
