# Track Specification: Create Centralized Course Home Page

## Overview
Create a top-level `index.html` at the repository root (`Materials/index.html`) that serves as the primary entry point for students. This page will provide organized links to all 9 days of course materials, lectures, labs, and quizzes.

## Objectives
- Provide a professional, branded dashboard for the UBUS 670 course.
- Simplify navigation by centralizing access to all "Week" and "Day" modules.
- Ensure the home page aligns with the "Visual Educator" style guide.

## Requirements
- **Location:** The file must be placed at `Materials/index.html` (which becomes the root of the GitHub Pages site).
- **Navigation:** Must include links to:
    - week-1 (day-1, day-2, day-3)
    - week-2 (day-4, day-5, day-6)
    - week-3 (day-7, day-8, day-9)
- **Visual Style:** Use the NIU brand colors (Cardinal and Black) and Montserrat/Georgia typography as established in the Day modules.
- **Responsive Design:** Must work beautifully on mobile and desktop.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `Materials/index.html` exists and is correctly styled.
- [ ] All links to Day Dashboards work correctly.
- [ ] The page is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages and accessible at the root URL.
