# Product Guidelines

## 1. Instructional Tone & Prose
*   **Style:** Educational, direct, and conversational. Avoid overly academic jargon unless it is a defined term of art in AI.
*   **Accessibility:** Ground abstract AI concepts in relatable business metaphors. Every "how-to" must be accompanied by a "so-what" (business value).

## 2. Visual Education Standards (The "Visual Educator Rule")
*   **Full-bleed Imagery:** Every lecture slide should feature a high-quality, evocative image or illustration that anchors the concept. Text should be minimal and secondary to the visual.
*   **Functional Diagrams:** Use simplified flowcharts and decision matrices to explain processes (e.g., RAG pipelines, agent loops). Clarity of logic takes precedence over artistic complexity.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Never use more than three bullet points per slide. If more detail is needed, split the content across multiple slides or provide it in the lab documentation.

## 3. Lab & UX Design
*   **Scenario-Based Learning:** Every lab must be situated within the "Beacon Retail Group" case study or a similar realistic business scenario.
*   **Scaffolded Learning:** Tasks should progress from simple to complex to build student confidence.
*   **Explanatory Feedback:** Quizzes and labs must explain *why* an answer is correct or why a setting affects the output.
*   **LMS Compatibility & Assessment:**
    *   **Submission Artifacts:** Quizzes must provide a "Download Results as PDF" feature to facilitate simple submission to Blackboard Ultra.
    *   **Hosting:** Content must be served via **GitHub Pages** to provide stable, direct URLs for linking within the LMS. All assets (images, scripts) must use relative paths to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
    *   **Rubric-Based Grading:** Every lab (standard labs for Days 1-7; **Final Project labs for Days 8-9**) must include a structured **Markdown Grading Rubric**. This rubric serves as the source of truth for AI agents (or instructors) to evaluate student work.

## 4. Content Quality & AI Integrity
*   **Priority 1: Verified Accuracy:** All AI-generated content and explanations must be technically accurate and safe. Never hallucinate API capabilities or model performance.
*   **Priority 2: Current Technology:** Always use and reference the latest frontier models and techniques relevant to the course (e.g., Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash, Agentic workflows).
*   **Priority 3: Contextual Integrity:** Maintain the "Beacon Retail Group" context as the primary thread throughout the course to ensure a cohesive narrative experience.
