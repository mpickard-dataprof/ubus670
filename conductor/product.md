## Vision
To transform MBA students into "AI-aware" future leaders by providing a highly interactive, accessible, and visually rich 9-day course. The program bridges the gap between complex generative AI technology and practical business strategy, focusing on no-code/low-code tools and real-world application.

## Target Audience

*   **Hands-on Labs:** Immersive business scenarios—such as email triage automation and competitor analysis—using tools like Google AI Studio and Gemini Gems.
*   **Self-grading Quizzes:** Formative knowledge checks designed to reinforce learning through immediate, explanatory feedback.
