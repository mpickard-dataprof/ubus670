# Project Status: UBUS 670 Course Development

**Last Updated:** Friday, February 27, 2026
**Current Track:** `lab_rubrics_20260225` (Implement Markdown Grading Rubrics for Labs 1-7)

## 🎯 Achievements this Session
- Established a master grading rubric template in `Materials/_shared/`.
- Completed Week 1 rubrics (Days 1-3) and created checkpoint `9033778`.
- Completed Week 2 rubrics (Days 4-6) including specialized executive personas (Marketing Director, CFO, CTO).

## 🚀 Next Action
Finalize Phase 2 of the rubric track by committing the Week 2 files, then proceed to Phase 3 (Day 7 rubric).

## 📝 Context for Resumption
The Week 2 files (Days 4, 5, 6) are currently sitting in the working directory uncommitted. The implementation plan (`conductor/tracks/lab_rubrics_20260225/plan.md`) needs to be updated to reflect the completion of Phase 2 once verified.
