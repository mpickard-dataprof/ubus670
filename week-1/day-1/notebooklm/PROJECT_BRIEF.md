## Known Issues with Current Slides (Instructor Feedback)

The instructor has reviewed the current slides and identified these problems:

1. **Text and bullet layout needs improvement** — bullets are too cramped, font sizes too small, numbers don't align well with lead-in text
2. **Need better images** — current images are logo-style clip art; need high-quality, relevant illustrations generated by an AI image agent
3. **Whitespace balance is off** — some slides have too much empty space, others are too cramped
4. **Part 2 (How LLMs Work) needs expansion** — should cover embeddings in more depth; see reference PPTX for the level of depth expected
5. **Checkpoint quiz (slide 15) is broken** — answers pre-selected, needs to be interactive
6. **Part 3 (Hallucinations) needs more examples** — flesh it out with additional real-world cases
7. **Part 5 (Meet Google Gemini) needs more detail** — help non-tech-savvy students; go beyond the obvious for students who may have used ChatGPT
8. **Slide 22 (Why We're Using Gemini)** — text layout needs improvement

## What We Want From NotebookLM

Generate a Slide Deck that improves on the current version by:

1. **Better visual design** — more engaging layouts, better use of space, more visual variety
2. **Better images/illustrations** — suggest or include relevant visuals for each concept
3. **Improved whitespace and typography** — proper spacing around bullets, readable font sizes
4. **Stronger educational flow** — clearer transitions, better concept scaffolding for non-technical students
5. **More engaging presentation** — less text-heavy, more visual metaphors and analogies
6. **Maintain the content** — don't remove topics, but feel free to reorganize or expand them

## What to Preserve

- The Beacon Retail Group case study and scenario
- The 5-part structure (What is Gen AI → How LLMs Work → Hallucinations → Limitations → Google Gemini)
- The learning objectives
- NIU Red (#C8102E) as the primary accent color
- Professional, MBA-appropriate tone (not childish, not overly corporate)
