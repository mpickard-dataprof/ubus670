# Grading Rubric: Day 2 Lab — Crafting Prompts for Beacon

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
*   Apply the RCTFC framework (Role, Context, Task, Format, Constraints) to structure effective business prompts.
*   Distinguish between and apply zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques.
*   Execute a systematic iteration cycle to refine AI outputs based on specific business needs.
*   Evaluate AI outputs critically and compare results with peers to understand non-determinism.

## 📋 Submission Requirements
*   [ ] A completed Lab Report (PDF) containing all 12 reflection and rewrite textareas.
*   [ ] Confirmation of progress: Minimum 80% of steps checked in the interactive guide.

## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RCTFC Mastery** | Rewritten prompts (Task 2) perfectly utilize all five components; extremely specific and actionable. | Prompts use most RCTFC components and show clear improvement over the "bad" versions. | Prompts are still missing critical components like Context or Constraints. |
| **Prompting Techniques** | Demonstrates clear understanding of when to use few-shot vs. zero-shot and CoT; reflections are insightful. | Correctly executes the techniques, though reflections may be basic. | Improper application of techniques (e.g., missing examples in few-shot). |
| **Iteration Cycle** | Round 3 prompt (Task 5) shows sophisticated refinement that significantly improves the manual outline. | Round 3 prompt adds some useful detail but remains somewhat generic. | No Round 3 prompt provided or it adds no new value to the output. |
| **Analytical Depth** | Reflections show high-level critical thinking about AI reliability and its impact on Beacon Retail. | Reflections are accurate and complete but lack specific business depth. | Reflections are extremely brief or show a misunderstanding of the concepts. |

## 🤖 AI Feedback Protocol
*   **Persona:** Act as a Senior AI Architect at Beacon Retail Group reviewing a prompting strategy.
*   **Tone:** Rigorous, detail-oriented, and professional.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Look specifically at the **Chain-of-Thought** reflection—did the student realize *why* the step-by-step reasoning changed the result?
    2.  Check the **RCTFC rewrites** for Task 2—these should be the strongest part of the submission.
    3.  Highlight the student's ability to "sculpt" the output through the iteration cycle in Task 5.
