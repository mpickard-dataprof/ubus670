### GENERAL FEEDBACK
- in general, some of the topics need reworked (see specific comments below), some topics like "ai-ready documents" are given too much attention.
- improve the flow and scaffolding of the topics.
- in gneeral figure out how to condense the material but keep the same information -- there's too m uch redundancy and fluff.

### Slide 13
- not sure the "Scanned images (OCR errors) is true.  Gemini and other models are really good at reading images.  Please verify.  In fact, I'm not sure any of the items in "What struggles" are true any more.  Please do fresh research.  Generally, I like the idea of "What works well" --> it centers on using structure.  Please use a slide or two to introduce markdown, json, xml -- just make them aware, it doesn't have to go deep.  Show examples.  And decide what to do about the "What struggles".
-  Rethink the "Rule of thumb" after addressing the above bullet.


### Slides 14-17
- use what you learn in slide 13 research to update these slides
- In face, so many slides dedicate to this questionable topic of "struggle" seems redundant.  I'd rather replace with with a gentle, technical introduction to structured formats (like markdown, JSON, XML)

### Slides 18-19
- gemini 1.5 is old and out-dated.  Get the latest and update this slide.
- show a visualize example of chunking
- We need to connect chunking to the business students.  Provide a concrete no-code example of chunking a document?  Does that even make sense to do given the audience? Have several agents review it and generate ideas and go with the best one.

### Slide 21
- given the feedback in 14-17, remove this slide.  It's too much focus on ai-ready documents.

### Slide 22
- how can we adapt this given the feed in prior slides.  I like the idea of the exercise although its not technically interactive)

### Slide 24
- definitely reuse some of the embedding explanations and visuals from Day 1, BUT take them to the next level.
- add slides to discuss types of embeddings (pros and cons of each) and vector databases (like from a "be aware these technology products exist).

### Slide 25
- I like this analogy!!! Can we enhance it with an image?  You still haven't caught the vision of helpful graphics.  Does Claude not have an image generation model?  Do I need to give you an API key for Google Nano Banana?  See the PNG in the feedback folder.  I generated it with this prompt: "Create me a image that emphasizes and teaches the topics in this slide. The audience is MBA students learning about context engineering and RAG." (You could make a better prompt.).  Create a tool or agent that can design more images like this?

### Slide 26
- I love the flowchart.  See PNG image feedback.  And the arrows could be improved.  Send it to UX / Visual designer agent for feedback.

### Slide 28
- The general consensus is that general models (like Claude Opus and Gemini) are getting smart enough that fine-tuning scenarios are going away.  In general, remove "fine-tuning" from the slides, quiz, etc. HOWEVER, let's mention it on this slide and comapre it to RAG.  But we need a better comparison.  Do research.  And please incorporate this example (perhaps in another slide): My colleague, created her own custom ChatGPT and then repeatedly "chastised" it when it jumped to "solve her problem".  She told it to just listen and emphathize.  Eventually, it became a good listener.  She's an accountant and wanted to use this model to train auditors to listen and understand.  She hired an software developer to extract the embeddings and weights in the "fine-tuned" model to replicate it. So she didn't "fine-tune" the model in the traditional way...just through repeated interactions.  Please make several slides on this, maybe a comic strip. AT LEAST a really nice visual or storyboard to convey this example.  I'm imagining a visual of a neural network showign the weights as the brain or heart of the ChatGPT being trained and then extracted from the "agent".   Be createive.

### Slide 31
- improve the alignment of this slide (full justification).  This is something the visual reviewer should have caught.  IN FACT, after you've implemented all my feedback, please send it back for review (visually).
