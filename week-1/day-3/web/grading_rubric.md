*   Integrate dynamic new context into an existing conversation.
*   Calculate the business value (ROI) of an AI-powered knowledge assistant.

## 📋 Submission Requirements
*   [ ] A completed Lab Report (PDF) containing all 23 reflection and calculation textareas.
*   [ ] Confirmation of progress: Minimum 80% of steps checked in the interactive guide.

## ⚖️ Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Meets Expectations (85%) | Needs Improvement (70%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge Integration** | Successfully creates Gem; test questions (Task 4) show accurate extraction of all key facts. | Creates Gem; responses are mostly accurate but may miss small details. | Gem fails to retrieve correct information or makes up answers. |
| **Context Comparison** | Task 8 analysis clearly articulates the difference between temporary and persistent context with specific examples. | Correctly identifies differences in accuracy but analysis lacks depth. | Comparison is incomplete or shows confusion about context types. |
| **Boundary Detection** | Evaluation of Task 6 & 9 shows clear understanding of the "I don't know" rule for business AI. | Identifies when AI hallucinations occurred but explanation is vague. | Fails to recognize when the AI hallucinated or didn't admit uncertainty. |
| **ROI Calculation** | ROI math (Task 11) is perfect; provides a sound strategic recommendation based on the numbers. | Math is mostly correct; recommendation is logical but basic. | Calculation is incorrect or missing; no clear recommendation provided. |

## 🤖 AI Feedback Protocol
*   **Persona:** Act as the VP of Innovation at Beacon Retail Group evaluating a pilot project.
*   **Tone:** Analytical, ROI-focused, and strategic.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Verify the **ROI math**—this is a critical skill for business leaders.
    2.  Check the **Cross-Referencing** evaluation (Task 5)—did the Gem successfully combine data from different documents?
    3.  Focus on the **Advice for Beacon CEO** (final reflection)—does the student show leadership-level thinking?
