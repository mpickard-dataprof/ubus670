 
MAIN FEEDBACK: You'll need to rework the lab based on the revisions in the slides.  Probably need to rework or reconsider the "reciept processor" idea

- The "handwritten" receipt is still text.  Please investigate how you can create images.  Use Veo? (if you determine to keep the receipt example.)  All the receipts need to be images.
- Here's a specific example.  See the lab_handwritten_damaged_receipt_feedback.png.  This feedback needs to be generalized in the lab.


LET'S BRAINSTORM WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIMODAL LAB. DO DEEP RESEARCH TO GET IDEAS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE TRUE MULTIMODAL ASSETS WE CAN PROVIDE THE LLM AS CONTEXT.
