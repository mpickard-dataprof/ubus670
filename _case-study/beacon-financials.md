## Financial Summary

Beacon Retail Group is **financially stable but facing margin pressure**. Our challenges are operational, not existential:

- **Revenue is growing**, but slowly
- **Margins are thin** and being squeezed by labor costs
- **E-commerce is a bright spot**, but still small
- **Customer satisfaction lags** industry averages
- **Seasonal hiring is expensive** and inefficient

**The opportunity:** If AI can help us reduce costs, improve customer experience, or make better hiring decisions, the ROI case is strong. Even modest improvements in our identified challenge areas could save $500K-$1M annually.
