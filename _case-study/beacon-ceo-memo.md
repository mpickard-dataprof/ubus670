# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**BEACON RETAIL GROUP**

---

**TO:** AI Strategy Task Force Members

**FROM:** Patricia Holloway, Chief Executive Officer

**DATE:** March 3, 2026

**RE:** Launch of AI Strategy Task Force — Your Mission

---

## Welcome to the Task Force

Thank you for agreeing to serve on Beacon Retail Group's first-ever **AI Strategy Task Force**. I'm personally excited about this initiative and confident that your work will shape Beacon's future.

As you know, Beacon has thrived for nearly 40 years by staying close to our customers and communities. But the retail landscape is changing faster than ever. Our competitors are investing heavily in artificial intelligence—from automated customer service to predictive inventory management. We need to understand where AI can help Beacon compete and grow, while staying true to our values.

**That's where you come in.**

---

## Your Mission

Over the next three weeks, your task force will:

1. **Learn** how generative AI and related technologies actually work (not just the hype)
2. **Evaluate** specific opportunities where AI could create value for Beacon
3. **Build** proof-of-concept solutions for our most pressing challenges
4. **Recommend** which initiatives we should pursue—and which we should avoid

I'm not asking you to become AI engineers. I'm asking you to become **AI-literate business leaders** who can make informed decisions about this technology.

## Our Most Pressing Challenges

I've consulted with the executive team, and we've identified three areas where AI might have the greatest impact:

### 1. Seasonal Hiring (HR)

Every fall, we scramble to hire 300-400 seasonal workers. Our HR team is overwhelmed with applications, and we often make rushed decisions that lead to high turnover. Last year:

- We received **4,200 applications** for seasonal positions
- Our HR team of 3 spent **6 weeks** on initial screening
- **42% of seasonal hires** didn't complete the holiday season
- Cost of a bad hire: approximately **$2,500** (training, turnover, lost productivity)

*Can AI help us screen candidates more effectively without introducing bias?*

### 2. Customer Service (Marketing)

Our customers increasingly expect personalized experiences, but we're serving them with generic communications. Meanwhile, our customer service team spends hours answering the same questions repeatedly. Current state:

- **850 customer emails per week** (avg. 4-hour response time)
- **60% are routine inquiries** (store hours, return policy, order status)
- No personalization in marketing emails beyond "Dear [First Name]"
- Customer satisfaction score: **72%** (industry average: 78%)

*Can AI help us respond faster and create more personalized customer experiences?*

### 3. Expense Management (Finance)

Our store managers submit expense reports with paper receipts. Our finance team manually enters data, categorizes expenses, and flags anomalies. It's slow and error-prone:

- **1,200 expense reports per month** across 25 stores
- Average processing time: **8 days**
- Error rate in manual entry: **~4%**
- Suspected policy violations caught late: **unknown (that's a problem)**

*Can AI extract data from receipts and flag issues before they become problems?*

## What I Expect From You

### By the End of Week 1:
- Understand AI fundamentals well enough to separate hype from reality
- Begin applying prompt engineering to Beacon scenarios

### By the End of Week 2:
- Have working prototypes for at least one Finance and one Marketing challenge
- Understand how to evaluate and test AI solutions

### By the End of Week 3:
- Present a working multi-agent system for our seasonal hiring challenge
- Deliver recommendations to the executive team (I'll be there)

---

## Resources Available

- Full access to Beacon company data (sanitized for this exercise)
- Google Workspace accounts with AI tools enabled
- Support from our IT team for technical questions
- My door is always open—I want to hear your honest assessments

---

## A Note on Governance

As excited as I am about AI's potential, I'm equally concerned about the risks. Before we deploy anything customer-facing:

- We must ensure we're not introducing bias, especially in hiring
- We must protect customer and employee data
- We must maintain the human touch that differentiates Beacon
- We must be transparent about when customers are interacting with AI

Your recommendations should address these concerns head-on. I'd rather hear "this isn't ready" than rush into something that damages our reputation.

---

## Final Thoughts

Beacon has always been a company that adapts. We survived the 2008 recession. We weathered the pandemic. We're still here when many regional retailers have disappeared.

AI represents both an opportunity and a threat. Done right, it can help us serve customers better and operate more efficiently. Done wrong—or ignored entirely—it could leave us behind.

I'm counting on this task force to help us get it right.

Let's make Beacon's next chapter its best one yet.
