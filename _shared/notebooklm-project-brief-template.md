## What We Want From NotebookLM
1. **Visual design** — consistent illustrations, professional layouts, strong whitespace
2. **Content preservation** — all content has been accuracy-checked and updated; preserve the facts and figures exactly
3. **Better visual metaphors** — especially for: {{KEY_VISUAL_METAPHORS}}
4. **Educational flow** — clearer scaffolding with visual section breaks between major sections
5. **Business framing** — every technical concept tied to Beacon Retail Group's scenario
6. **Readable at distance** — large fonts, clear hierarchy, designed for projection in a lecture hall

## Critical Output Requirement
The slides will be used **as full-bleed background images** in Reveal.js. They must be:
- Visually self-contained (all text and graphics baked into each slide image)
- High quality at 16:9 aspect ratio
- Readable at presentation scale (large fonts, clear hierarchy)
- Consistent visual style across all slides
