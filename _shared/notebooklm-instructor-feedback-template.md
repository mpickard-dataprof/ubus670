## Visual Design Notes (from UX Review)
- All SVG text throughout the lecture uses font sizes too small for projection (9-10px) — increase to 12-14px minimum
- Section dividers need visual elements (icons, illustrations) to break monotony
- Maintain consistent color coding: Red (#C8102E) for emphasis/action, Navy (#1D428A) for structure/headers, Blue (#00A9E0) for information/secondary
- The most important examples must be readable at projection distance — increase font sizes for code blocks and system prompt examples
